You\\'ll need this ID to join relevant tables to the base table.\\r\\ndate_decision - This refers to the date when a decision was made regarding the approval of the loan.\\r\\nWEEK_NUM - This is the week number used for aggregation. In the test sample, WEEK_NUM continues sequentially from the last training value of WEEK_NUM.\\r\\nMONTH - This column represents the month and is intended for aggregation purposes.\\r\\ntarget - This is the target value, determined after a certain period based on whether or not the client defaulted on the specific credit case (loan).\\r\\nnum_group1 - This is an indexing column used for the historical records of case_id in both depth=1 and depth=2 tables.\\r\\nnum_group2 - This is the second indexing column for depth=2 tables\\' historical records of case_id. The order of num_group1 and num_group2 is important and will be clarified in feature definitions.\\r\\nAll other raw columns in the tables serve as predictors. Their definitions can be found in the file feature_definitions.csv. For depth=0 tables, predictors can be directly used as features. However, for tables with depth>0, you may need to employ aggregation functions that will condense the historical records associated with each case_id into a single feature. In case num_group1 or num_group2 stands for person index (this is clear with predictor definitions) the zero index has special meaning. When num_groupN=0 it is the applicant (the person who applied for a loan).\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious predictors were transformed, therefore we have the following notation for similar groups of transformations\\r\\n\\r\\nP - Transform DPD (Days past due)\\r\\nM - Masking categories\\r\\nA - Transform amount\\r\\nD - Transform date\\r\\nT - Unspecified Transform\\r\\nL - Unspecified Transform\\r\\nPlease note that transformations within a group are denoted by a capital letter at the end of the predictor name (e.g., maxdbddpdtollast6m_4187119P). We hope that this will simplify the manipulation with predictors.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdits:\\r\\n\\r\\npmts_month_158T is for active contract\\r\\npmts_month_706T is for closed contract\\r\\ndateofcredstart_181D - Start date of a credit contract.\\r\\n\\r\\nFeature Description:\\r\\nactualdpd_943P: Days Past Due (DPD) of previous contract (actual).\\r\\nactualdpdtolerance_344P: DPD of client with tolerance.\\r\\naddres_district_368M: District of the person\\'s address.\\r\\naddres_role_871L: Role of person\\'s address.\\r\\naddres_zip_823M: Zip code of the address.\\r\\namount_1115A: Credit amount of the active contract provided by the credit bureau.\\r\\namount_416A: Deposit amount.\\r\\namount_4527230A: Tax deductions amount tracked by the government registry.\\r\\namount_4917619A: Tax deductions amount tracked by the government registry.\\r\\namtdebitincoming_4809443A: Incoming debit card transactions amount.\\r\\namtdebitoutgoing_4809440A: Outgoing debit card transactions amount.\\r\\namtdepositbalance_4809441A: Deposit balance of client.\\r\\namtdepositincoming_4809444A: Amount of incoming deposits to client\\'s account.\\r\\namtdepositoutgoing_4809442A: Amount of outgoing deposits from client\\'s account.\\r\\namtinstpaidbefduel24m_4187115A: Number of instalments paid before due date in the last 24 months.\\r\\nannualeffectiverate_199L: Interest rate of the closed contracts.\\r\\nannualeffectiverate_63L: Interest rate for the active contracts.\\r\\nannuity_780A: Monthly annuity amount.\\r\\nannuity_853A: Monthly annuity for previous applications.\\r\\nannuitynextmonth_57A: Next month\\'s amount of annuity.\\r\\napplicationcnt_361L: Number of applications associated with the same email address as the client.\\r\\napplications30d_658L: Number of applications made by the client in the last 30 days.\\r\\napplicationscnt_1086L: Number of applications associated with the same phone number.\\r\\napplicationscnt_464L: Number of applications made in the last 30 days by other clients with the same employer as the applicant.\\r\\napplicationscnt_629L: Number of applications with the same employer in the last 7 days.\\r\\napplicationscnt_867L: Number of applications associated with the same mobile phone.\\r\\napprovaldate_319D: Approval Date of Previous Application\\r\\nassignmentdate_238D: Tax authority data - date of assignment.\\r\\nassignmentdate_4527235D: Tax authority data - Date of assignment.\\r\\nassignmentdate_4955616D: Tax authority assignment date.\\r\\navgdbddpdlast24m_3658932P: Average days past or before due of payment during the last 24 months.\\r\\navgdbddpdlast3m_4187120P: Average days past or before due of payment during the last 3 months.\\r\\navgdbdtollast24m_4525197P: Average days of payment before due date within the last 24 months (with tolerance).\\r\\navgdpdtolclosure24_3658938P: \"Average DPD (days past due) with tolerance within the past 24 months from the maximum closure date:  assuming that the contract is finished.
